        <h3>Programming & Design</h3>
        <p>
          I first became introduced to programming and web design when I was about 16. I used HTML and CSS, along with an early version of Bootstrap.
          I had no idea what I was doing, but after a couple weeks I had a personal website. Now, over a decade later, I still have no idea what I'm doing.
          Except now I use Python and HTML5.

        <h3>Home Audio & Video</h3>
        <p>
          You know what's cooler watching a great film at the move theater? That theater being in your own home.
          I love home theater: the speakers making sounds you never heard before, the subwoofer (oh, the subwoofer)
          making the ground shake, the screen (all 120" of it) right at your finger tips.
          No ads, reasonably priced condiments, and whatever movie you want. Heaven on Earth.

        <h3>Nuclear Power</h3>
        <p>
          There are many environmentally friendly altenatives to fossil fuel based energy production, but none of them have the potential of Nuclear power.
          Fusion may still be a dream, but recent breakthroughs (Ignition!) have made this dream more tangible goal and less fantastical delusion.
          Even fission, the dirty, unpopular brother of fusion is a tremendous option for producing clean energy.
